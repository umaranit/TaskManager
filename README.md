# Hackathon Content: Modernizing the Task Manager Application

## Hackathon Title:
**"Modernize and Innovate: Task Manager 2.0"**

---

## Objective:
Participants will modernize the provided Task Manager application by implementing a modern front-end framework, integrating a back-end API with microservices architecture, adding database functionality, and incorporating an AI-powered feature. The goal is to create a scalable, feature-rich, and intelligent task management solution.

---

## Hackathon Deliverables:
Participants are expected to deliver the following:

### 1. Modernized Front-End:
- Replace the existing jQuery-based front-end with a modern framework such as **React.js**, **Angular**, or **Vue.js**.
- Ensure the **UI is responsive** and adheres to modern design principles.
- Maintain and enhance the existing functionality (e.g., task addition, editing, deletion, sorting, and searching).

### 2. Back-End API with Microservices Architecture:
- Develop a back-end API using **Java**, **.NET**, or **Python**.
- Implement a **microservices architecture** to handle different functionalities (e.g., task management, user authentication, analytics).
- Ensure the API is **RESTful** and follows best practices for scalability and maintainability.

### 3. Database Integration:
- Add database functionality using **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, or **Azure SQL**.
- Store tasks, priorities, due dates, and completion status persistently.
- Implement **CRUD operations** for tasks in the database.

### 4. AI Feature Integration:
- Add an **AI-powered feature** to enhance the application. Examples include:
  - **Task Recommendation**: Suggest tasks based on user behavior or priorities.
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Allow users to add tasks using natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call John tomorrow at 3 PM").
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze task descriptions to determine urgency or mood.
  - **Predictive Analytics**: Predict task completion times based on historical data.

### 5. Documentation:
- Provide clear **documentation** for the front-end, back-end, and database setup.
- Include instructions for **deploying** the application locally or on the cloud.

## Hackathon Guidelines:

### 1. Team Composition:
- Teams can consist of **2-5 members**.
- Each team should have a mix of **front-end**, **back-end**, and **database expertise**.

### 2. Technology Stack:
- **Front-End**: React.js, Angular, or Vue.js.
- **Back-End**: Java (Spring Boot), .NET (ASP.NET Core), or Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI).
- **Database**: MySQL, MongoDB, or Azure SQL.
- **AI Tools**: OpenAI API, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other AI/ML library.

### 3. Evaluation Criteria:
- **Functionality**: How well the application works and meets the requirements.
- **Innovation**: Creativity in implementing the AI feature.
- **Code Quality**: Clean, modular, and well-documented code.
- **Scalability**: Use of microservices and database design for scalability.
- **UI/UX**: Modern and user-friendly interface.

### 4. Submission Requirements:
- **Source code** hosted on GitHub or any other version control platform.
- A short **video demo** showcasing the applicationâ€™s features.
- **Deployment instructions** or a live demo link (optional but preferred).

## Judging Criteria and Guidance
To evaluate the teams, consider:
- Creativity & Completeness: How well did the team understand and implement the use case?
-	Utilization of GitHub Copilot: Did they effectively use Copilot to assist with coding and problem-solving?
-	Code Quality & Documentation: Is the modernized implementation clean, efficient, and well-documented?
-	Demo: A working output
